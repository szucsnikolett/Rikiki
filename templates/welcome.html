                <li>The dealer deals the cards.</li>
                <li>The dealer takes a card from remaining deck and place it down. That is the trump card.</li>
                <li>Players begin to bid how many tricks they can take.</li>
                <li>Play begins: you must place same color as the first player in turn.</li>
                <li>If you do not have the same color, you can either put a trump or anything.</li>
                <li>The hand will be won by the highest card or who places trump down.</li>
                <li>Once all cards have been played, the dealer tallies up the score.</li>
                <li>If a player takes the exact number of tricks he bid, he receives 10 points, plus twice number he bid.</li>
                <li>If a player takes any other number of tricks, he will be deducted points.</li>
